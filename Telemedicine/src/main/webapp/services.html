                <h3>Nutrition</h3><br>
                <p>Nutrition is a critical part of health and development. Better nutrition is related to  improved infant, child and maternal 
                    health, stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy and childbirth, lower risk of non-communicable diseases (such as 
                    diabetes and cardiovascular disease),and longevity.Healthy children learn better.People with adequate  
                    nutrition are more productive and can create opportunities to gradually break the cycles of poverty and hunger.
                    Malnutrition, in every form, presents significant threats to human health. Today the world faces a double burden of
                    malnutrition that includes  both undernutrition and overweight, especially in low- and middle-income countries.WHO is
                    providing scientific advice and decision-making tools that can help countries take action  to address all forms of 
                    malnutrition to support health and wellbeing for all, at all ages.</p>

            <h3> Primary Health Care</h3>
           
            <p>All people, everywhere, have the right to achieve the highest attainable level of health. This is the fundamental premise of primary health care (PHC).
                Primary health care is a whole-of-society approach to effectively organize and strengthen national health systems to bring services for health and 
                wellbeing closer to communities.</p>
            <p>It has 3 components: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>integrated health services to meet people’s health needs throughout their lives</li>
                <li>addressing the broader determinants of health through multisectoral policy and action</li>
                <li>empowering individuals, families and communities to take charge of their own health.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Primary health care enables health systems to support a person’s health needs from health promotion to disease prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, 
                palliative care and more.This strategy also ensures that health care is delivered in a way that is centred on people’s needs and respects their preferences.

                <h3>Mental Health </h3><br>
                <p>
                Mental health is all about how people think, feel, and behave. Mental health specialists can 
                help people with depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, addiction, and other conditions that affect
                their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
                Mental health can affect daily living, relationships, and physical health.
                However, this link also works in the other direction. Factors in people’s lives, interpersonal 
                connections, and physical factors can contribute to mental ill health.
                Looking after mental health can preserve a person’s ability to enjoy life. Doing this involves 
                balancing life activities, responsibilities, and efforts to achieve psychological resilience.
                Stress, depression, and anxiety can all affect mental health and disrupt a person’s routine.
                Although health professionals often use the term mental health, doctors recognize that many 
                psychological disorders have physical roots.
